# Mostly Default Theme

A lightly-modified version of the default theme with a few quality-of-life features:

- Native dark mode
- Desktop and mobile rendering
- Automatic discoverability for RSS feeds
- Easily override partial CSS
- Markdown-formatted links and images
	- `[Link](link)`
	- `![Image](image)`
- Detect if properties exist before rendering
	- Date - no longer says "January 1, 1"!
	- Tags - lists only if at least one is present
